## Execution
**If you are having troubles with executing VSA, please read this guide. First, you will have to copy the URL of the LS.lua file, then you need to put it into a loadstring, which looks like this `loadstring(game:HttpGet(""))()` Once you have done that, it should look like this `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verisuna/VSA/main/LS.lua"))()`. Currently, we do not have a UI. We are working on that soon, though. So for now to customise VSA you can use
 `_G.Fov = 
_G.Sides = 
_G.ShowFov = 
_G.HitChance = `
All of these settings are personal preference, although if you are looking for a recommended configuration you can copy the one below. 
 `_G.Fov = 95
_G.Sides = 100
_G.ShowFov = true
_G.HitChance = 100`
The finished script should look like this:
`_G.Fov = 95
_G.Sides = 100
_G.ShowFov = true
_G.HitChance = 100
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verisuna/VSA/main/LS.lua"))()`
